In order to understand song popularity, we have done an in depth analysis on word frequency of lyrics and the sentiment of those words. This was done through public APIs provided by Spotify and Genius, and tested against two different public playlists including the current Top 50 songs in the United States and a larger data set of mixed eras and genres of popular music.
